# Week 1 â€“ Python Basics

## What I Practiced
- Variables, lists, loops, dictionaries, functions, conditionals
- Jupyter Notebook workflow
- Basic data loading and exploration with pandas

## Challenges I Faced
- I have forgotten a lot of the syntax for pandas and working in dfs.

## What I Want to Improve
- I know how to do these thing, but haven't worked with them in a while. I want to improve my recall and be able to accomplish these tasks with less syntax research.
